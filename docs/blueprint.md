- Multilingual AI Crop Advisory: Provides location-specific crop advice in multiple languages using AI. The AI uses the current weather and predicted weather patterns as a tool in decision-making.

- Pest/Disease Detection: Allows users to upload images to detect pests and diseases.
- Market Price Tracking: Displays current market prices for crops.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#73A66C), representing growth and nature.
- Background color: Very light desaturated green (#F2F4F1).
- Accent color: Muted gold (#D4AC0D), symbolizing value and prosperity. This will also stand out on the desaturated green background.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern, humanist sans-serif. Since there are both long and short forms of text, this choice suits the design well.
- Use clear and intuitive icons representing different crops, weather conditions, and advisory categories.
- Prioritize a clean and straightforward layout with easy navigation.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience without distracting from the content.
